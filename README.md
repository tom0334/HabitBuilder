# HabitBuilder
A open source habit tracker for android, built with the idea of porting to IOS at a later stage. HabitBuilder is currently in early stages of development.

The main idea of the app is to put the amount of times you did your habit per day at the forefront. Pretty graphics to visualize the progress and heavy platform integration is planned, in the form of widgets and home screen shortcuts.

HabitBuilder is written in pure Kotlin (no java dependencies) for the main business logic. This should make it possible to port to IOS later. All platform depencies are written as interfaces as much as possible, so when porting to IOS it should be sufficient to make IOS specific implementations.
